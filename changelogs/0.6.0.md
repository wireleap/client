    - REST API implemented according to spec

      subcommand
    - `import` now requires proper URL as input (`file://` or

    - all CLI commands except `start` require `wireleap` API to be
      running
    - `completion.bash` updated to match new CLI

        - `contract` made obsolete by `contract.json`

        - `address.h2c` is now `address`
        - `circuit` moved under `broker.circuit`
        - `timeout` moved under `broker.circuit.timeout`
        - new `forwarders` section with `socks` and `tun`
        - `address.socks` moved under `forwarders.socks.address`
        - `address.tun` moved under `forwarders.tun.address`
        - migration to new config file format added
