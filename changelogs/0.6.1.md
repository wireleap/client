# 0.6.1

- Depends on `wireleap/common` v0.3.6.

- `wireleap_tun` bypass API:
    - `wireleap` no longer creates/uses `bypass.json`
    - bypass list changes are written directly to `wireleap_tun.sock`
    - removed dependency on `fsnotify/fsnotify` in `wireleap_tun`
    - `wireleap_tun` now handles setting IPv6 routes correctly
    - `wireleap_tun` IPv6 bind failure workaround applied
    - `tun` will no longer start without a configured service contract

- API call retry interval changed to 150ms (was 100ms), total wait
  increased to 15s (was 10s)

- Wireleap broker state logic improved wrt race conditions

- git version now includes `+` instead of `-`, marking the extra
  information at the end of the version number as build info instead of
  pre-release version suffix as per the semver spec
